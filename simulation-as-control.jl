md"# Simulation as a control problem"

# ╔═╡ 9e4cf0fc-6654-4123-993e-39aa714b3731
md"""
It is commonly assumed that the brain's motor system makes use of internal models of the musculoskeletal system and the environment in order to control motor behaviour.

We will briefly discuss ideas originating in [Wolpert & Kawato (1998)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608098000665) and explore their application to the mental simulation of behaviour.

> Humans exhibit an enormous repertoire of motor behavior which enables us to interact with many different objects under a variety of different environments.

Motor behavior is formulated as a control problem. In general, the problem of control can be considered as the computational process of determining the input to some system we wish to control ir order to achieve some desired output.

In essence, we can define _control_ as the attempt to make dynamical systems behave in a desirable way.

As an example, consider lifting a cup to ones lips. The desired output at time $t$ is a particular acceleration of the hand (as judged by proprioceptive sensory feedback). The input to the system must be a motor command.

# ╔═╡ 7b82b21f-dd19-4f6b-89a4-917f3c7ad770
md"""
Motor commands depend on many variables:
- (varying) state of the body (positions, velocities, orientation relative to gravity)
- (unvarying) masses, moments of inertia, etc.
- knowledge of interactions with outside world (e.g. geometry and properties of cup)

All these (and more) can be considered as the context $C$ within which movement takes place. Motor commands must be tailored to take into account the current context.

## Forward and inverse models

The notion of an internal model, a system which mimics the behavior of a natural process, has emerged as an important theoretical concept in motor control.

There are two varieties of internal model, forward and inverse models. 

Forward models capture the forward or causal relationship between inputs to the system, e.g. the arm, and the outputs (Ito, 1970; Kawato et al., 1987; Jordan, 1995). A forward dynamic model of the arm, for example predicts the next state (e.g. position and velocity) given the current state and motor command.

In contrast, inverse models invert the system by providing the motor command which will cause a desired change in state. Inverse models are, therefore, well suited to act as controllers as they can provide the motor command necessary to achieve some desired state transition.

As both forward and inverse models depend on the dynamics of the motor system, which _change throughout life and under different contextual conditions, these models must be adaptable_.

## Multiple models

Wolpert & Kawato (1998) claim that there is evidence for the existence of multiple (independent) controllers (as opposed to one monolithic controller). The problem of choosing which model is responsible for actually controlling behaviour can be seen as a model selection problem.

__Assumptions__: At any given time, only certain controllers are active. Only the active controllers can be assessed for performance errors. 

The basic idea of Wolpert & Kawato's model is that multiple inverse models exist to control the system and each is augmented with a corresponding forward model. The brain therefore contains multiple pairs of coupled forward and inverse models. Further, there exists a _responsibility signal_ (for a given model) which reflects, at any given time, the degree to which each pair of forward and inverse models should be responsible for controlling the current behavior. This responsibility signal is derived from the combination of two processes. The first process uses the forward model’s predictions errors. The second process, the responsibility predictors, use sensory contextual cues to predict the responsibility of the module and can therefore select controllers prior to movement initiation in a feedforward manner.

> I don't know yet if it's worth exploring their model in great detail.




## Forward and inverse models as inference

In a more modern take, forward and inverse models can be interpreted as two types of inference in a probabilistic model. 

This will allow us to deal with uncertainty.

## Model

We consider an agent's motor system, which we wish to control by issuing a sequence of motor commands $u_{1...T}$. For simplicity, we consider discrete time. 

The resulting movement trajectory (state of the system) is $x_{1...T}$. 


The causal relationship between motor command $u$ and state $x$ is given by:

$x_{t+1} = f(x_t, u_t, c_t)$

This describes the _forward_ dynamics of the system. We assume that the dynamics of the system $f$ are not fixed over time but can take on a possibly infinite number of different forms. These different forms correspond to the context of the movement and include such factors as interactions with objects or changes in the environment. This can either be parameterized by assuming there is a set of system dynamics $f_i$ with $i = 1, 2, ..., n$ or by including a context parameter $c$ as part of the dynamics.

The aim of control is to produce a system which can generate an appropriate motor command $u_t$ given the desired state, $x_{t+1}^\ast$.

"""

md"""
The agent can move (left/right) by applying a force. Neglecting pretty much everything else (mass, friction, etc.), the applied force results in a single cycle sinusiodal acceleration. 

Therefore, the agent's motor action will result in an acceleration. We know that acceleration, $\alpha$, is the second derivative of position. We can therefore numerically integrate (twice) the acceleration over a time period to obtain the velocity, $\omega$, and then the position.

$$\begin{align}
\omega_t &=  \dot{θ}_t\\
\alpha_t &= \dot{\omega}_t = \ddot{\theta}_t = u_t\\
r_{t+1} &= r_t + c \, i_t
\end{align}$$

Using this information, we can write the agent's motion as a system of 1st order difference equations. These implement Newtonian kinematics.

$$\begin{align}
 u_t &= \alpha_t \\
\alpha_t &= D \cdot A  \cdot sin(2 * π * f * (t-\phi)) \\
\omega_{t+1} &= \omega_{t} + \Delta t \cdot \alpha_t \\
\theta_{t+1} &= \theta_{t} + \Delta t \cdot \omega_{t} + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t ^2 \cdot \alpha_t \\

## Control 

What we did above was use the model to perform a forward simulation of the expected consequences of applying a motor command. The problem of controlling, i.e. selecting an appropriate action, is the inverse problem: in this case, figuring out which parameter settings to use in order to achieve a desired target position.

Say, for example, that the agent wishes to go to position $\theta = 10$. For simplicity, let's assume that the agent doens't care how long it takes to get there.


The problem can be construed in serveral ways. I propose that we either look at it as an optimization problem, or as a problem of Bayesian inference.

### Control as inference

The goal is to infer a posterior distribution over the parameters, conditioned upon setting $\theta = 10$. The parameters of interest are the duration and apmplitude; the direction of motion is given by the target position, since we are not (yet) considering circular motion.

The agent has to perform the following steps:
1) Set up probabilistic model.
2) Infer parameters, conditioned upon setting position to the desired value.

We are assuming that the agent can only perform one type of motion (sinusiodal acceleration), and has perfect knowledge of the form of the acceleration. Further, the acceleration is parameterized using $D$, $A$, $\phi$. $f$ is set to $1$ because the agent's motor system can only perform a single cycle pf motion.
